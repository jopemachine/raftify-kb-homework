# Byzantine Faults
Byzantine faults refer to failures in a distributed system where components (nodes) may behave erratically or maliciously, making it difficult for the system to reach consensus. This term originates from the Byzantine Generals' Problem, which illustrates the challenges in achieving reliable communication and agreement in the presence of treacherous actors.

- **Consensus Difficulty**: Achieving agreement among nodes is hard when some nodes may lie or behave inconsistently.

Byzantine fault tolerance remains a critical area of research and implementation for ensuring reliability and security in modern distributed systems.
