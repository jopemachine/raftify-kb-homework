# Two Generals' Problem
The Two Generals' Problem addresses the challenge of two armies needing to coordinate an attack on a common enemy **at the same time**, focusing on the **reliability of communication** between them.

## Problem Description
 Two generals each lead their own army and must attack the enemy **simultaneously** to succeed. The generals communicate via messengers, who "may be intercepted or fail" to deliver messages.

- **Unreliable Communication**: The generals cannot be certain whether their messages have been successfully delivered.

## Conclusion
The Two Generals' Problem illustrates the fundamental issue of reliable communication in distributed systems. It demonstrates the impossibility of achieving guaranteed synchronization in an environment where message delivery is uncertain.
